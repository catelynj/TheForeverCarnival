# CarnivalRepo

This is the second project from Farm Forever Games, a student-ran group at the Pennsylvania College of Technology learning the ins and outs of game design and programming.

The Forever Carnival is a minigame-based physics-driven experience that allows the players to fulfill both their casual and competitive sides with fun carnival games.
